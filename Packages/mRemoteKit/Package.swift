import PackageDescription

// The product app is an Xcode project; this package holds the layers that do
// not need UIKit, so they can be built and tested on the development host
// without a Simulator. The module boundaries follow docs/architecture.md,
// section 3: dependencies point downwards only, and nothing here may import a
// protocol implementation.
