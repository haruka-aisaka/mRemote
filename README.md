# mRemote

An RDP client for iPadOS/iOS, and for macOS through Mac Catalyst. Its reason
to exist is the Japanese keyboard: the Eisu and Kana keys on a physical JIS
keyboard are sent to Windows as Muhenkan and Henkan instead of being consumed
by the system's input switcher.

This is a personal project, developed by one person against one iPad, one
keyboard and one Windows host. See
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for the design documents and for the
verification scale everything here is held to.

## Layout

The repository is one product, so the tree is organised by role rather than by
platform.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `mRemote.xcodeproj`, `App/` | The app: the connection list, the profile editor, settings and the full-screen session workspace. `AppTests/` and `AppUITests/` sit beside it. |
| `Packages/mRemoteKit/` | The app layers that need no UIKit, so they build and test on the development host: `SessionCore`, `Persistence`, `AppleAdapters`, `RDPProtocol`. |
| `bridge/` | The C ABI over FreeRDP. Opaque handles only; no FreeRDP type reaches Swift. |
| `scripts/`, `config/`, `ThirdParty/`, `artifacts/` | Reproducible builds of the pinned native dependencies, their lock file, notices and SBOM, and the generated XCFrameworks. |
| `tools/KeyEcho/` | A Win32 recorder that logs what scancodes actually arrived at Windows. |
| `tools/Phase0Harness/` | The UIKit/Metal spike app. Now a fixture for physical input checks rather than product code. |
| `docs/` | Requirements, architecture, input design, UI flow, data and security, test plan, roadmap. |
| `phase0/` | The Go/No-Go spike: its decision, records and notes. |

## Status

Phase 0 is closed with a `GO` for the personal baseline: FreeRDP runs on
device, a real NLA/TLS session renders a desktop, and Eisu/Kana reach Windows
as Muhenkan/Henkan without iPadOS consuming them. See
[`phase0/README.md`](phase0/README.md).

Phase 1 meets its exit criteria: the app runs end to end against
`FakeRemoteSession`, passwords never reach the profile document, the schema is
versioned with a tested migration chain, and a second protocol would be added
by registering a factory rather than by changing a call site.

Phase 2 connects the real thing: `RDPRemoteSession` runs FreeRDP behind the
same `RemoteSession` interface, the workspace draws the desktop on a Metal
surface fed by dirty regions, and a server certificate is reviewed with its
fingerprint rather than accepted quietly. Its remaining exit criteria are the
ones that need a machine rather than a test: thirty minutes against the
Windows host, and the bridge sanitizer stress carried over from Phase 0. See
[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

Phases 3 to 6 are implemented ahead of their device checks, verified with
automated tests and on the iPad simulator only: `GCKeyboard` arbitration with
quarantine and the remote cursor (3), multiple sessions with a switcher and
automatic reconnect (4), focused-session audio and two-way clipboard text (5),
and the software keyboard with local/host IME modes and an extended key bar
(6). Each phase's table in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) marks what still
needs the iPad and the Windows host.

The Mac build is the same app through Mac Catalyst. Each connection opens in
a window of its own beside the list, the Mac's keyboard and mouse go to
Windows as they are (⌘ is the Windows key, ⌥ is Alt; 英数/かな are
Muhenkan/Henkan; only ⌘Q, ⌘H, ⌘M, ⌘\` and ⌃⌘F stay with the Mac), and the
iPad-only parts - the software keyboard, the laptop deck, the hinge - are left
out. Text and images on the clipboard follow the user both ways without the
session menu. It has been checked against the Windows host from a macOS 26 VM; see
[`docs/input-design.md`](docs/input-design.md) section 12.

A connection can also be marked as reaching a Mac running
[macos-rdp-server](https://github.com/mikuta0407/macos-rdp-server). It then
offers the Mac RDP eXtensions ([macrdpx](https://github.com/mikuta0407/macrdpx),
the `external/macrdpx` submodule): once the server agrees, keys go as Mac keys
with their exact modifiers (⌘ stays ⌘, Fn, left/right), the pointer and the
trackpad's pixel scrolling with momentum go natively, and the stream quality
(frame rate and bit rate) is chosen per connection - automatically lower on
cellular - and changeable from the session menu. A Retina client gets a HiDPI
desktop sized to its window. Any other server stays plain RDP; see
[`docs/input-design.md`](docs/input-design.md) section 13.

## Build and test

Clone with `--recurse-submodules` (or run `git submodule update --init`):
the bridge compiles `external/macrdpx`.

The app target links the generated `artifacts/FreeRDP.xcframework` and
`artifacts/mRemoteRDPBridge.xcframework`, which are ignored by git and have to
be built once before the app will link. `Packages/mRemoteKit` deliberately
does not declare them, so `swift test` works in a fresh clone with no native
build; the app does not.

```sh
# The app, its unit tests and the end-to-end UI test
xcodebuild test -project mRemote.xcodeproj -scheme mRemote \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad mini (A17 Pro)'

# The Mac app (Mac Catalyst, Apple silicon)
xcodebuild build -project mRemote.xcodeproj -scheme mRemote \
  -destination 'platform=macOS,variant=Mac Catalyst,arch=arm64'

# Host-testable app layers
swift test --package-path Packages/mRemoteKit

# Phase 0 harness logic
swift test --package-path tools/Phase0Harness

# C bridge contract tests
cmake -S bridge -B /tmp/mremote-bridge -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DMR_BRIDGE_BACKEND=unavailable
cmake --build /tmp/mremote-bridge && ctest --test-dir /tmp/mremote-bridge
```

The active toolchain must be a full Xcode rather than the Command Line Tools,
otherwise the Swift test targets cannot resolve XCTest. Prefix with
`DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` if
`xcode-select -p` points at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.

Building the native dependencies from source is documented in
[`phase0/README.md`](phase0/README.md). In short:

```sh
scripts/build-freerdp-xcframework.sh
scripts/build-rdp-bridge-xcframework.sh
```

Both XCFrameworks carry three slices: `ios-arm64`, `ios-arm64-simulator` and
`ios-arm64-maccatalyst`. An artifact built before the Mac slice existed has
to be rebuilt, or the Mac build will not link.

The Mac app keeps passwords and approved certificates in the data-protection
Keychain, which macOS only opens to an app signed with a team (the project's
automatic signing does this). An ad-hoc signed build runs, but asks for the
password and the certificate on every connection.
